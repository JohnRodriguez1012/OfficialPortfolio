                            I am glad you were able to stop by and check out what I have done. I recently finished a coding bootcamp at the University of Richmond and I am currently looking for full-time employment remotely or in Charlotte, North Carolina.

                            With my portfolio, I have highlighted some web applications I have created, while using various technologies like JavaScript, ReactJS, CSS, HTML, and more! I also included some information about what I am looking for, what I hope to provide, and some fun facts about myself.
