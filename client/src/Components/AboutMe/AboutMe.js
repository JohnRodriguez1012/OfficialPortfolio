                I am a New Jersey transplant that relocated to Virginia after graduating from Randolph-Macon College with a degree in music. My first job out of college was a sales position with a local insurance company. After 6 months as a sales agent, I was moved to a project role within the customer service department to help better the sales training.

                Shortly after the project role, I was promoted to a recruiter position. Without having any background in human resources, much of my first few weeks in the role was learning as much as I could while recruiting for various operation departments. After several months, I was put in charge of recruiting for all the operation departments in both the Texas and Virginia offices.

                After I started collecting data on candidates and recent hires, I was tasked with creating a database. Once I saw the potential of the databases that I could create with SQL, I decided to learn more through websites like CodeAcademy and Udemy. After getting hooked on learning how to make my own basic webpage, I decided to dive headfirst in a coding bootcamp at the University of Richmond. I've recently graduated and Iâ€™m actively looking.
