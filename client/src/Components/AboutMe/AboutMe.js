            <h3> How did I get here? </h3>
            <h4>
                I began my career in an insurance agency, where leadership rapidly recognized my drive, analytical skills, and project management abilities, tapping me to take on progressively larger projects within recruiting and organizational development.

            <br/>
            <h4>
                Within my first year as a recruiter, I restructured our hiring process, built a pipeline for vacancies, and created reports and KPIs to measure recruitment effectiveness. In that process, I was asked to create a database for managing and monitoring candidate test performance. After rudimentary efforts in Excel, I taught myself SQL and my love of coding and development was born.

                In April of 2018, I completed the University of Richmond’s Coding Bootcamp, a 24-week program focused on designing and building web applications. In addition to gaining hands-on experience in full-stack development on NoSQL and open source platforms, I had the opportunity to learn and grow along industry leaders and hone my technical and communication skills in a collaborative environment.

                Currently, I am exploring new opportunities in the Richmond area and would welcome the opportunity to learn more about your company — and how I can add value to the talented team you already have in place.
